Reflection on your experience with this assignment: 
This assignment was a lot more straightforward than previous assignments. If I could continue to work on this, I would implement j-unit testing along with the testing the methods in Main.java. I found it very interesting to see how spell checkers like grammarly could potentially work and it was fun to get to try and build one myself.
